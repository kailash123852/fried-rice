If you're done reading the ingredients, lets start!

1] Boil the Rice
-a] Take the quantity as you wish, a regular rice cooker is enough
-b] Boil the Rice (Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in rice and salt and return to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid, 16 to 18 minutes (check only toward the end of cooking time)).

2] Scramble your eggs
Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them into small pieces as you  
go.  Then transfer the eggs to a separate plate, and set aside.

3] Sauté your veggies and garlic
Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.

4] Stir fry rice
Then turn the burner to high heat.  Scooch the veggies over to one side of the pan, melt the remaining butter in the other half, and add the chilled rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using).  Then stir to combine with the veggies and continue sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3 minutes, or until you notice the rice and veggies starting to brown slightly.

5] Remove pan from heat.
And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled eggs.

6] Taste and season
Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, plus any extra soy sauce or sesame oil if needed.

7] Serve!
Then dish it up and serve nice and warm!



Another Way (explained in a bit different method)

Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a large sauté pan* over medium-high heat until melted. Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally. Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.

Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat until melted. Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for about 5 minutes or until the onion and carrots are soft. Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, and stir until melted. Immediately add the rice, green onions, soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using), and stir until combined. Continue sautéing for an additional 3 minutes to fry the rice, stirring occasionally.  (I like to let the rice rest for a bit between stirs so that it can crisp up on the bottom.)  Then add in the eggs and stir to combine. Remove from heat, and stir in the sesame oil until combined.  Taste and season with extra soy sauce, if needed.
